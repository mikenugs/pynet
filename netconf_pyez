Netconf is a standardized API that is supported by network vendors. Was originated by Juniper.
At the lowest layer uses secure transport over SSH over TCP port 830. 

!To configure on Juniper

set servoces netconf ssh

!To configure on Cisco IOS XE

netconf-yang

Ideally you want to use a library to deal with Netconf and not nccclient you PyEZ juniper abstracts lower layer machanics
Inside the SSH session you will be sending XML within an RPC or RPC reply tag message. Embedded inside those messages Netconf supports GET, GET-CONFIG, EDIT-CONFIG, LOCK-DEVICE.. etc. Inside all of that you will have the XML data.

Yang is a modeling language and specifies what the data should look. What fields should be there and what those fields should look like, string, number ...etc. It does not specify how to get it to the device. It will tell you how the interface should be configured. Historically the Yang would get converted to XML and get passed across the Netconf session to the remote device which will deconstruct the XML and get back the yang data model. Now the yang data model has been decoppled from the underlying API Netconf transport using things like Restconf. So instead of SSH transport you will use URL's and HTTP's with GET, POST, DELETE options to accomplish what we 
want to accomplish. GRPC has also been used as a transport protocol for Netconf as well. 

!Using NCCCLIENT

from ncclient import manager
from getpass import getpass
from pprint import pprint

with manager.connect(
    host="srx2.lasthop.io",
    # host="cisco3.lasthop.io",
    port=830,
    username="pyclass",
    password=getpass(),
    hostkey_verify=False, <-- turned off host key verification
    allow_agent=False,
    look_for_keys=False, <-- does not use SSH key verification
) as netconf_manager:

pprint(netconf_manager.server_capabilities.__dict__) <-- server capabilities is used so each side can communicate what they are capable of doing

!With this example you use all of the same above configuration

conn = manager.connect( <-- Here we use an object for the Netconf connection as apposed to closing it immediatly with the with command.

config = conn.get_config(source="running")
config_xml = config.data_xml <-- gives a XML string rendering back
print(config_xml)

!Juniper PYEZ Library

Created by Juniper to help interface to the Netconf API. 

from jnpr.junos import Device <-- here we import device from the Juniper PYEZ library
from getpass import getpass
from pprint import pprint

a_device = Device(host="srx2.lasthop.io", user="pyclass", password=getpass()) <-- pass in login info
a_device.open() <-- Open/establish the Netconf session 
pprint(a_device.facts) <-- here we retrive facts back


!Here we look at predefined tables to look at information. You can find a list of these tables here

https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos-pyez/topics/reference/general/junos-pyez-tables-op-predefined.html

from jnpr.junos import Device
from jnpr.junos.op.ethport import EthPortTable <-- Here we import EthPortTable in addition to the device class
from getpass import getpass
from pprint import pprint

# import ipdb

a_device = Device(host="srx2.lasthop.io", user="pyclass", password=getpass())
a_device.open() <-- Establish the Netconf connection

# ipdb.set_trace()
ports = EthPortTable(a_device) <-- here we pass in the Netconf connection to the EthportTables
ports.get()  <-- Goes to the device gathers the information and returns it back in a dictionary

print(ports)
print(ports.keys()) <-- will show you all the ports
pprint(ports.values())
pprint(ports.items()) <-- will show you the information within the port

!If it says zip it wants you to iterate over it you can do a 

list(ports['fe-0/0/7'].items()) <-- this will return the data back in tuples
dict(ports['fe-0/0/7'].items()) <-- this will return the data back in a dictionary

!You can also iterate through this

for k in ports:
    print(k)

for k, v in ports.items():
    print(k)
    print(v)
    break <-- will stop after the first iteration

!Juniper PYEZ Example #2

from jnpr.junos import Device
from jnpr.junos.op.arp import ArpTable
from getpass import getpass

# from pprint import pprint

a_device = Device(host="srx2.lasthop.io", user="pyclass", password=getpass())
a_device.open()

arp_entries = ArpTable(a_device) <-- we use the ArpTable class and pass in the a_device Netconf object which will return back structured data
arp_entries.get()

dir(arp_entries) <-- will tell us which methods are available to us
help(ArpTable) <-- will tell us more information

arp_entries.keys() <-- will give us back the MAC address
arp_entries['ACTUAL MAC'] <-- To get detailed info on that dictionary key
dir(arp_entries['ACTUAL MAC']) <-- to show what methods are available to you from this point
arp_entries['ACTUAL MAC'].keys() <-- to see the keys
arp_entries.items() 

!You can also iterate over this data

for x in arp_entries.items():
    print(x)
    break

!Using PyEZ for operational configurations

from jnpr.junos import Device <-- here we import the Device class
from jnpr.junos.utils.config import Config <-- Here we import the Config class
from getpass import getpass

a_device = Device(host="srx2.lasthop.io", user="pyclass", password=getpass())
a_device.open()
a_device.timeout = 60 <-- Timeout changed since Junos operations can sometimes take extra time to run

cfg = Config(a_device) <-- Take Config class and pass in the Netconf object to create the cfg object
cfg.lock() <-- This will prevent anyone else from making a change at the same time

cfg.load("set system host-name test123", format="set", merge=True) <-- Here we add the single line of configuration
cfg.rollback(0) <-- This will rollback the configuration

cfg.load("set system host-name test123", format="set", merge=True)
print(cfg.diff()) <-- This will perform a configuration DIFF

# cfg.commit() <-- This will commit the configuration and add the comment
# cfg.commit(comment="Testing from pyez") <-- This will commit but add a comment as well

cfg.load(path="test_config.conf", format="text", merge=True)
cfg.unlock() <-- This will unlock the configuration so other people can enter config mode

!Juniper PyEZ with config file

from jnpr.junos import Device
from jnpr.junos.utils.config import Config
from getpass import getpass

a_device = Device(host="srx2.lasthop.io", user="pyclass", password=getpass())
a_device.open()
a_device.timeout = 60

cfg = Config(a_device)
cfg.lock()

cfg.load(path="test_config.conf", format="text", merge=True) <-- here we load the config from a config file. Text instead of set means that the syntax will be curly braze notation instead of set commands
# cfg.load(path="test_replace.conf", format="text", merge=False) <-- If you use the merge=False you need to specify replace in the config as well. With replace it removes that portion of the config that you are trying to push and implement whatever you are trying to push.
# cfg.commit()
# cfg.commit(comment="Testing from pyez")
# cfg.unlock()

!PyEZ configuration and XML

from jnpr.junos import Device
from jnpr.junos.utils.config import Config
from getpass import getpass

a_device = Device(host="srx2.lasthop.io", user="pyclass", password=getpass())
a_device.open()
a_device.timeout = 60

cfg = Config(a_device)
cfg.lock()

cfg.load(path="test_config.xml", format="xml", merge=True) <-- here we specify the XML configuration
# overwrite=True - full configuration replace so be careful
# cfg.commit(confirm=1)
# cfg.commit()
# cfg.unlock()

 ----------- XML for configuration -----------

<configuration>
        <routing-options>
            <static>
                <route>
                    <name>1.1.4.0/24</name>
                    <next-hop>10.220.88.1</next-hop>
                </route>
            </static>
        </routing-options>
</configuration>

!You can check the config difference using

print(cfg.diff())

!You can also do a commit confirmed

cfg.commit(confirm=1)

!If you specify overwrite then it will delete the entire configuration and load your config as the new active configuration

cfg.load(path="test_config.xml", format="xml", overwrite=True)

!Juniper PYEz and RPC requests to retrieve information

!What you would want to do to get the configuration syntax to send is log into the router
and perform a "show <command> | display xml rpc" there you can get the output of the syntax to send to the router.
When the syntax comes back you can get the RPC syntax it will be between the
<rpc>
  HERE YOU WILL FIND THE COMMAND TO USE just strip the <> at the end ALSO CHANGE THE - to a _
</rpc>

# get_lldp_neighbors_information()
xml_out = a_device.rpc.get_lldp_neighbors_information() <-- Makes an RPC request to the device using Netconf. It takes the get information from the RPC output from the show command in this example get_lldp_neighbors_information. We then add a method call at the end ()
print(etree.tostring(xml_out, encoding="unicode")) <-- to print this we use etree from the XML library we convert it to a string and pass it the variable name from our API call object. Encoding = unicode does the same thing as the decode that we have done in previouse examples
