!TextFSM is a Python package created by Google. When working with network equipment some do not have good API's so we need to use SSH to parse CLI.
You can use Python and RegeX but the issue with this is RegEx can get very complicated and hard to maintain.
TextFSM can be used instead of RegEx. With regex you use text characters to represent patterns that you see in strings.

!To see where textfsm is installed 
textfsm.__file__

!With TextFSM you have to create a template file

a.) entries and output we are extrancing these are the value defintions

Value VAR_NAME (regex_pattern)
Value VAR_NAME (regex_pattern)
Value VAR_NAME (regex_pattern)

b.) State machine part of the template here we define a new state LLDP

Start
    ^Device.*ID -> LLDP

LLDP
    ^${VAR_NAME}.* -> Record

# Implicit EOF and Record
# EOF

! To install

pip install textfsm
pip install colorama <-- to get color feedback

-------- template example file name is show_ip_int_brief.template

Value INTERFACE (\S+) <-- this will match all non whitespace characters
Value IP_ADDR (\S+)
Value LINE_STATUS (up|down)
Value LINE_PROTOCOL (up|down)


Start
 ^Interface.*Protocol\s*$$ -> ShowIPIntBrief <-- This is done to remove the first line of output

ShowIPIntBrief
  ^${INTERFACE}\s+${IP_ADDR}.*{LINE_STATUS\s+${LINE_PROTOCOL}\s*SS -> Record

!To execute 

python textfsm.py show_ip_int_brief.template show_ip_int_brief.txt
